    <h3>Description of the dish</h3>
        <p>
            A crepe is a thin, delicate pancake originating from France, known for its versatility and light texture. Unlike the fluffier American pancakes, crepes are typically made from a simple batter of flour, eggs, milk, and a pinch of salt, sometimes enhanced with a touch of sugar for sweet versions. The batter is spread thinly over a hot, greased skillet or crepe pan, cooking quickly to a golden brown with a slightly crisp edge.

            Crepes can be served in a variety of ways: sweet or savory. Sweet crepes are often filled with fruits, jams, chocolate spread, or whipped cream, and dusted with powdered sugar or drizzled with syrup. Savory crepes might be filled with ingredients like ham, cheese, eggs, or saut√©ed vegetables, sometimes folded into a neat triangle or rolled into a cylinder. These fillings create a delightful contrast with the crepe's light, slightly chewy texture.
